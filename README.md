This is a small plan for my own game.


At present, I only have a very basic plan for my future game design.

It would be an EDU game for elf. Everyone can choose an small egg at first, and use the different items to raise the elf after hatching the egg. Moreover, the choices of various items would bring distinct influence on the further growth of the elf. You may create a beauty in the end, or unfortunately, a strong man with bushy sideburns and mustache. The result would be set as half random, so who knows.    

the whole game would be established with pygame, for I don't know how to use other game-edit platform (shameful lol), and the figure designer would also be myself (luckiy I know a little bit drawing). The whole plan is just based on my own interests and the motivation of study, no other intentional usage (because it cannot hhhh).

Hopefully I can insist on doing this and update it time to time.
